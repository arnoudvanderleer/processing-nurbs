# The Nurbs library

## Building
To build a distribution, go into the `/build` folder and run `ant` (which will run as `ant clean` by default). This will
- Compile the library to the `/docs/download` folder;
- Compile the webpage from the `/web` folder to the `/docs` folder;
- Generate documentation using `javadoc` to `/docs/reference`;
