## Circle
This example displays a classic nurbs curve: a circle. The detail with which it is drawn depends on the x coordinate of the mouse.

## Surface
This example shows an animated wavy surface in a 3D scene.
The central control point of this surface moves around while the other points move back to forth to give a wave-like motion.
Using the up and down arrow keys the user can change the weight of the central point.
